Hand-in: 

You will get an email from administration with instructions. If you need to hand in a report, then: the report on the first page is your name. If the report must have many pages, then every other page contains screenshots of the final application. If asked to hand-in code, then you ZIP your application.


In the front page, put the link to your cloud application (PythonAnywhere)


Questions: Only on the public Teams channel.


Individual exam: The exam is individual, yet you are welcome to work in groups. Keep in mind that you must know all the code for the exam.


All the requirements must be fulfilled unless stated otherwise. Failure to do so will imply a 00 at the exam.

Front-end validation everywhere

Back-end validation everywhere

Proper use of HTTP methods in the routes

Proper response of HTTP statuses codes


Front-end: HTML, CSS or MojoCSS/TailwindCSS, JavaScript, MixHtml or any library of your choiceÂ½

It must be a proper looking website, easy to navigate, and responsive.


Note: If there are issues sending the email from PythonAnywhere, then you can demonstrate this step by using "localhost" or "127.0.0.1"


All the code we have created in the class, all the information in our Teams group, any link in this document, any video I have linked to, all of it is part of the exam.
